//Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
}

//Explanation :

// This problem wasnâ€™t too difficult. I realized that I would be using string interpolation Once the question mentioned that I would have to pull the name from the argument and place it within the static string.
