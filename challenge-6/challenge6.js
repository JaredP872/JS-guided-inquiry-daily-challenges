// Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

function doubleInteger(i) {
  // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
  return i * 2;
}

//Explanation:

// This problem required me to return an integer and double it. Once I read the question and picked out the context clues I simply created a function syntax and returned i which was the parameter and multiplied whatever the value of i would be times 2.
