// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

function greet() {
  return "hello world!";
}

//Explanation:
//This problem was simple. All that was required for me to do was return the string ‘’hello world’’ using a functions syntax. This didn’t take me much time at all.
